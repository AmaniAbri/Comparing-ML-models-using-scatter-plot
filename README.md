# Comparing-ML-models-using-scatter-plot

## Describtion
The prediction power of differnt ML models can be compared using equality line (1:1) of the scatter plot. 1:1 line is used as a refrence in 2-D scatter plot to compare sets of data. This line has a slope of 1. The prediction power of ML models can be compared using this line as the best performance of a model has a corresponding scatters fall exactly on the identity line or close to the line.
